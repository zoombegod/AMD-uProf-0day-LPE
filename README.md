# AMD-uProf-0day-LPE
 I originally discovered this vulnerability sometime during the summer of 2021. However, I never made a proper exploit for it.

# Oh.
 I found out that there are no blatantly-obvious wrmsr instructions that are trivial to call. I do not want this to be a new, "main project."

 I suppose I have something to fall back to if I ever need something to do.
